## Key points:

    1. To solve any pattern problem we need to use nested loops.
    2. Here, for outer loop focus on the number of rows you are trying to print, For e.g.:
        *       -row1
        **      -row2
        ***     -row3
        **      -row4
        *       -row5
    The above pattern has 5 rows
    3. For inner loop focus on columns and try to connect them with the no. of rows, i.e., try to find out some relation between the rows and columns
    4. Print the values inside your inner loops. Here, in the above example the values are '*'
    5. Observer the symmetry of the patterns. [optional]
